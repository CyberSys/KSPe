# KSP API Extensions/L :: Change Log

* 2019-0728: 2.1.0.15 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.2
	+ Fixing last minute mishaps:
		- More robust Unity version identification and handling
		- Better coping with current practices on KSPe.IO.File.Assets
	+ Known issue:
		- KSPe.UI doesn't loads on KSP <= 1.3.1 due an idiotic mistake on handling dependencies. Delete it from `000_KSPAPIExtensions/Plugins` as a temporary measure.  
* 2019-0727: 2.1.0.14 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.2 REISSUE
	+ Adding formal dependency for [Click Through Blocker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/170747-151-click-through-blocker/) 1.7.2 on KSPe.UI.
	+ New UI helpers:
		- Message Box : Big, centered and modal Window
		- Alert Box with close countdown : smaller, positionable Window.
	+ New Image Utils
		- Universal Texture Loader (works on any Unity) 
* 2019-0718: 2.1.0.13 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.2 **WITHDRAWN**
	+ Withdrawn due a stupid mistake on compiling against a beta release of an third-party Add'On
* 2019-0524: 2.1.0.10 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.2
	+ KSPe goes gold after 8 months in development! :)
	+ Adding a proxy to [Click Through Blocker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/170747-151-click-through-blocker/), what will allow seamless integration with it and new solutions
		- Including selecting the desired one in runtime!
		- Will raise the minimum supported KSP to the installed Click Through Blocker supported version.
* 2019-0503: 2.1.0.9 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.2 PRE-RELEASE
	+ Adding support for headers when saving ConfigNodes.
	+ Adding local cache support to the *.Solve functions (saving some processing on the client side, by avoiding hitting the Reflection stuff more than one time for file)
* 2019-0125: 2.1.0.8 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.2 PRE-RELEASE
	+ Preventing concurrent processes from playing havoc on the KSP/Unity logging.
		- No more entries being written in the middle of the previous ones! :) 	
	+ Better Listing Files support.
	+ Some more syntactic sugar
		- Adding generics syntax to ConfigNode's GetValue, making easier to port code from XML (PluginConfiguration) to CFG (ConfigNode) and vice versa
	+ Small refactoring on the class hierarchy
		- Some classes were deprecated, but will be maintained until the version 3
		- No impact to the user base, I'm the only client for this stunt! :D
	+ Removed Max KSP version check.
	+ Fixed a glitch that prevented debug messages from being suppressed.

	+ Adding install instructinos to the package, as suggested by [scottadges](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/174580-scottadges/) [on forum](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50911-13-kerbal-joint-reinforcement-v333-72417/&do=findComment&comment=3499125)
