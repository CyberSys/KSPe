# KSP API Extensions/L :: Changes

* 2019-0524: 2.1.1.0 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.2 PRE-RELEASE
	+ Adding a proxy to [Click Through Blocker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/170747-151-click-through-blocker/), what will allow seamless integration with it and new solutions
		- Including selecting the desired one in runtime! 
		- Will raise the minimum supported KSP to the installed Click Through Blocker supported version.
* 2019-0503: 2.1.0.9 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.2 PRE-RELEASE
	+ Adding support for headers when saving ConfigNodes.
	+ Adding local cache support to the *.Solve functions (saving some processing on the client side, by avoiding hitting the Reflection stuff more than one time for file)
* 2019-0125: 2.1.0.8 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.2 PRE-RELEASE
	+ Preventing concurrent processes from playing havoc on the KSP/Unity logging.
		- No more entries being written in the middle of the previous ones! :) 	
	+ Better Listing Files support.
	+ Some more syntactic sugar
		- Adding generics syntax to ConfigNode's GetValue, making easier to port code from XML (PluginConfiguration) to CFG (ConfigNode) and vice versa
	+ Small refactoring on the class hierarchy
		- Some classes were deprecated, but will be maintained until the version 3
		- No impact to the user base, I'm the only client for this stunt! :D
	+ Removed Max KSP version check.
	+ Fixed a glitch that prevented debug messages from being suppressed.
