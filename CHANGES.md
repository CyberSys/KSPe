	+ KSP Abstraction Layer Kick Off!
		- Specialised and transparent KSP UI support 
		- Specialised and transparent KSP specific version features
			- Including a Quick&Dirty MM patching support.
		- Bumping up minor version to allow Add'Ons to alert when running on older KSPe versions without these features.
