# KSP Enhanced /L :: Changes

* 2023-0212: 2.5.0.0 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.2
	+ Rebranding the thing into `KSPe Enhanced /L`, finally decoupling from the `KSPApiExtensions` heritage, now delegated as a secondary (and optional) feature.
	+ Removes deprecating artefacts marked for removal on 2.5 series
	+ Makes the thing deliverable on CurseForge **#HURRAY!!**
	+ Makes the thing deliverable on CKAN also.
		- `KSPe.InstallChecker` should not be installed under CKAN controlled KSP installments
	+ **This is a deal breaker release!!**
		- Add'Ons compiled against 2.4.x and 2.3.x relying on the removed artefacts **will break**.
