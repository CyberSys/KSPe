# KSP API Extensions/L :: Changes

* 2021-1020: 2.4.1.0 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.2
	+ Incepts `KSPe.UI.Toolbar`, a facade to allow the use of any Toolbar support (as long a driver is written for it on KSPe, or it supports KSPe nativelly).
		- Extremely unstable. Being published for R&D on the KSPU series.
		- Read the [Known Issues](./KNOWN_ISSUES.md) before risking your SAS with this stunt! :)
